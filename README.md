# Emotions

This will be a purely visual page to showcase my styling abilities and experiment with color and functionality. I plan to implement:
- Nice scroll effect that changes the background color - showcasing the Emotions
- Some information about the actual emotions, including the hormones and the way they influence our emotions
- A great color palette
- Elements that interact with the user

👷  The project is created using a CSS pre-processor - SASS.  
⛔️  The project will not use any frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
