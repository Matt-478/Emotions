# Emotions

This will be a purely visual page to showcase my styling abilities and experiment with color and functionality. I plan to implement:
- Nice scroll effect that changes the background color - showcasing the Emotions
- Some information about the actual emotions, including the hormones and the way they happen / form
- A great color palette
- Eleemnts that interact with the user
- Elements that interact with each other (f.i. when they are "stacked" in layers)

👷  The project is expected to take a minimum of 2 weeks and will possibly use a CSS pre-processor like LESS or SASS.  
⛔️  The project will not use any frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
